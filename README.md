## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Due to this challenge I was able to practice my some vanilla JS after a while as I was learning React for a while.I was able to push myself to deepen the knowledge of JavaScript.
Some of the Core topics on which I was able to decide while building this project are:

1. How to fire dragging events?
2. How to place dragged elements?
3. Where to declare new variables after inserting an adjacent HTML element?
